# Accessible Sport with Electrical Muscle Stimulation and Reinforcement Learning

üìå Overview

This repository contains the work developed as part of my TIPE project during the French preparatory classes.
The project explores how Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES), combined with reinforcement learning methods, can make sport more accessible for people with reduced mobility.

The case study focuses on the FES Bike, which uses electrical muscle stimulation to generate pedaling movements in patients with motor disabilities. By applying actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithms, the goal is to adapt stimulation policies dynamically, enabling autonomous and personalized use without prior calibration.

üèóÔ∏è Project Objectives
	1.	Introduce the principles of FES bikes and their application in rehabilitation and sport.
	2.	Theoretically study reinforcement learning methods and highlight their relevance to control problems.
	3.	Implement a Python-based reinforcement learning algorithm (actor-critic method) to control an FES bike simulation.
	4.	Analyze and discuss the results obtained with the proposed approach.
